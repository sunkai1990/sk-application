Recommend to run on Kaggle Kernal for the consistency of python package version

the input data is in the "input" folder
the python script "houseprice.py" is in the "run" folder

If run on Kaggle Kernal:
participate in "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition and paste the script into Kaggle Kernal and run it
or
create a new notebook, paste the script into Kaggle Kernal and add the "input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques" folder into Kernal 

If run on your computer:
Download and place the "input" and "run" folder in the same directory, and run "houseprice.py" in the "run" folder.


Thank u~
