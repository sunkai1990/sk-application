**Recommend to run on Kaggle Kernal for the consistency of python package version**

the input data is in the "input" folder
the python script "houseprice.py" is in the "run" folder

If run on Kaggle Kernal:
participate in "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition and paste "houseprice.py" into Kaggle Kernal and run it
or
create a new notebook, add the "input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques" folder into Kernal, and paste "houseprice.py" into Kaggle Kernal and run it

If run on your computer:
Download and place the "input" and "run" folder in the same directory, and run "houseprice.py" in the "run" folder.


Thank u~
